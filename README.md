# Single Cell Data Modelling
In this project, we performed comparison of various machine learning architectures that learn latent cell representations using clustering metrics and applying the intermediate representation to cell type annotation task, which acts as a precursor to disease identification.

We also performed a comparison of random split vs split based on donor ids and concluded that random split performs artificially well for biological data due to data leakage.

Our findings from this work are summarized in [report.pdf](https://github.com/aditigarg007/singlecelldatamodelling/blob/main/report.pdf)
